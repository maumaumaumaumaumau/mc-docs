# Getting started

Here's a little guide to get started with mau-code.

---

# Global Environment

Unlike old mau-code, the new version has a global environment wich holds variables and functions defined by the user and defined by the system.

# Upvalues

mau-code has upvalues wich are variables defined on the main environment or the last environment in wich a function was made. Editing those will also affect the environment overwriting the original values.
